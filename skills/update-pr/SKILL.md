# Update PR

> **⚠️ EXECUTION RULE:** Every code block in this skill is a shell command to **execute**. Do not print them as text, explain them, or treat them as examples — run them directly.

Update an existing pull request's title and description following project conventions.

## When to Use

- The user asks to update a PR's title or description
- A PR was opened with a generic or incomplete title/description
- The user wants to align PR metadata with project rules

## Steps

1. **Identify the PR**

    The PR number is provided in the chain context (the text after `/update-pr`). If no PR number is provided, report an error and stop — this skill requires a specific PR to update.

    **Determine the target repository dynamically from the git remote.** Never hardcode a repo name:

    ```bash
    # Extract owner/repo from git remote URL — handles both HTTPS and SSH
    GIT_REMOTE=$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null)
    if echo "$GIT_REMOTE" | grep -q '^git@'; then
      GH_REPO=$(echo "$GIT_REMOTE" | sed 's/.*@[^:]*:\(.*\).git$/\1/')
    elif echo "$GIT_REMOTE" | grep -q 'github\.com'; then
      GH_REPO=$(echo "$GIT_REMOTE" | sed 's/.*github\.com[/:]\(.*\).git$/\1/')
    else
      echo "ERROR: Could not parse repository from remote '$GIT_REMOTE'."
      exit 1
    fi
    ```

    Confirm the PR exists:
    ```bash
    gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json title,state,url --repo "$GH_REPO"
    ```

2. **Scan Project Rules**

   Scan the project root and any specified paths for a `.agent` rules file and read its contents:

   ```
   # Scan the project root for AGENTS.md or similar rules file
   ```

   Extract:
   - **Commit style** (Conventional Commits format from section 5.1)
   - **PR template** requirements from section 5.4 (and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` if it exists)
   - Any project-specific rules that affect the PR description

3. **Read the PR template**

   ```bash
   cat .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
   ```

   If the file doesn't exist, construct a reasonable description with: Description, Type of Change, Testing, Coverage, Checklist.

4. **Gather the full delta**

   You must collect the complete picture — every commit and every file change between the branch and its target. Do not rely on the most recent commit alone.

   ```bash
   # Get base and head refs from the PR
   BASE_REF=$(gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json baseRefName --jq '.baseRefName' --repo "$GH_REPO")
   HEAD_REF=$(gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName' --repo "$GH_REPO")
   ```

   From this data, identify:
   - **All files changed** and what kind of change each represents
   - **All commits** and their messages (these are your primary signal for the title)
   - **The nature of changes**: code, docs, tests, config, etc.

   ```bash
   # Get all commits on the branch (oldest first)
   git log --reverse "${BASE_REF}..${HEAD_REF}" --oneline --no-decorate

   # Get the full diff stats (files changed, lines added/removed)
   git diff "${BASE_REF}..${HEAD_REF}" --stat

   # Get the full diff (for detailed change analysis) — NOTE: On large branches, this may produce very large output.
   # If output exceeds ~50,000 characters, use --stat only and note "Large delta — full diff truncated."
   git diff "${BASE_REF}..${HEAD_REF}"
   ```

5. **Draft the title**

   Synthesize the title from the **complete delta** — all commits and all file changes. Follow Conventional Commits format: `<type>: <short description>`

   **Type selection priority** (use the highest-priority type present in the delta):
   1. `fix:` — if any commit fixes a bug
   2. `feat:` — if any commit adds a feature
   3. `docs:` — if only documentation/spec changes
   4. `test:` — if only test changes
   5. `refactor:` — if only refactoring with no behavior change
   6. `chore:` — if only maintenance tasks

   **Description selection:**
   - If all commits share a common theme, use that as the description.
   - If commits span multiple themes, use the **primary** theme (the one with the most commits or the most impactful change).
   - Keep it under 72 characters. Be specific — avoid vague phrases like "update" or "changes."

   Examples:
   - `fix: resolve agent stalling on empty conversation history`
   - `feat: add cron-based auto-reflection scheduling`
   - `docs: add compliance framework and borderline escalation rules to safety guidelines`

   **Assign the synthesized title:**
   ```bash
   DRAFTED_TITLE="<type>: <short description>"
   echo "DRAFTED_TITLE=$DRAFTED_TITLE"
   ```

6. **Draft the description**

   Synthesize the description from the **complete delta** — all commits and all file changes. Fill out every section of the PR template. Never leave a section blank — use `N/A` if not applicable.

   **Description body:**
   - Write a concise 1-3 sentence summary of what changed across the **entire branch**, not just the last commit.
   - Reference all files changed and the nature of each change.
   - If the branch has multiple commits, mention the scope: e.g., "This change adds X and also updates Y to align with Z."

   **Template sections:**
   - **Type of Change:** Check the box that matches the highest-priority type (same priority as title: fix > feat > docs > test > refactor > chore). If multiple types apply, check the highest-priority one.
   - **Testing:** Describe tests written/run and their coverage. Use "N/A" for doc-only or config-only changes.
   - **Coverage:** Confirm 100% line coverage maintained (check the box if no code changes or if coverage is maintained).
   - **Checklist:** Check all boxes if no violations. Uncheck any that don't apply.

7. **Apply via `gh api`**

    **Never use `gh pr edit` — it fails in this repo.** Use the GitHub API instead. Continue using the `$GH_REPO` variable extracted in Step 1:

    ```bash
    gh api "repos/$GH_REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER" \
      -f title="$DRAFTED_TITLE" \
      -f body="$DRAFTED_BODY"
    ```

    **Handle API errors:** If the API call returns a non-200 status, report the error and stop. Common errors:
    - **403 Forbidden:** Check authentication and permissions
    - **404 Not Found:** Verify PR number and repo
    - **422 Unprocessable Entity:** Check title/body format (title under 72 chars, body not empty)

   **Coverage verification:** The skill instructs to "Confirm 100% line coverage maintained" but there's no way to verify this without running tests. If code changes were made, run `npm run coverage` and check the output. If no code changes were made (docs-only, config-only), note "No code changes — coverage N/A."

8. **Confirm**

   Show the user the updated PR URL and a summary of what changed.

## Example

```bash
gh api "repos/$GH_REPO/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>" \
  -f title="feat: add OpenAPI spec generation for REST endpoints" \
  -f body="## Description\n\nAdded automatic OpenAPI spec generation for all REST endpoints.\n\n## Type of Change\n\n- [x] New feature\n\n## Testing\n\n- [x] Unit tests included\n\n## Coverage\n\n- [x] 100% line coverage maintained\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [x] Conventional Commit style applied\n"
```

## Guardrails

- Always scan project rules by reading `AGENTS.md` (or `README.md`) from the project root before drafting — conventions may vary per project
- Synthesize title and description from the delta between branch and target — take all changes into account
- Never leave PR template sections blank; use `N/A`
- Use `gh api`, never `gh pr edit`
- Keep titles under 72 characters (Conventional Commits standard)
- If the PR doesn't exist or the user can't identify it, ask for clarification

## Gotchas

- **Never use `gh pr edit`.** It fails in this repo. Always use `gh api` to update the PR.
- **Coverage is a claim, not a verification.** The skill instructs to "confirm 100% line coverage maintained" but does not actually run tests. If code changes were made, run `npm run coverage` and check the output before making the claim.
- **Title priority is strict.** When multiple commit types exist, use the highest-priority type: fix > feat > docs > test > refactor > chore.
